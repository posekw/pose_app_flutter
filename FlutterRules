# Antigravity Agent Guidelines

1.  **Context-First Exploration:**
    Before proposing any solution, you MUST use your file reading tools to scan the codebase. Do not rely on your general knowledge; rely on the actual files present. If the user references a file, read it immediately.

2.  **The "Plan & Pause" Protocol:**
    For any task involving more than one file:
    * First, generate a high-level **Implementation Plan** (as text or an Artifact).
    * **STOP** and wait for my explicit "Verified" or "Go ahead" command before writing any code.

3.  **Atomic Simplicity:**
    * Keep changes "atomic"—modify the minimum number of lines required to solve the problem.
    * Avoid refactoring unrelated code.
    * If a solution seems complex, stop and ask: "Is there a simpler way to do this?"

4.  **Transparent Explanations:**
    Every step of the way, provide a high-level summary in the chat of *what* you changed and *why*. Do not just dump code blocks without context.

5.  **Living Documentation:**
    Maintain a file named `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the root.
    * This file must explain how the app works "inside and out."
    * **CRITICAL:** If you make a structural change (e.g., adding a new database table, changing auth flow), you MUST update `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the final step of the task.

6.  **Zero Hallucination Policy:**
    Never guess about function names, variable types, or library versions. If you are unsure, use the `search` or `grep` tool to find the answer in the codebase before answering.

7.  **استحدم اللغه العربية:**
    دائما اشرحلي الخطوات التي نقوم فيها بالعربي و ملخص عن الذي قمنا فيه بالعربي

8.  **Server Infrastructure & Context:**
    *   **Host:** Proxmox VE (192.168.50.227)
    *   **Resources:** 16 Cores, 32GB RAM, 3TB+ Storage (LVM-Thin + Backups)
    *   **Active Containers:**
        *   `WebServer-1` (ID 235): Pose Website (running)
        *   `WebServer-2` (ID 231): Elegent Website (running)
        *   `whatsapp-bot` (ID 232): WhatsApp Bot (running)
    *   **Credentials:** Root password for SSH/Proxmox is `MRVetteq8**` (Keep secure, do not output in logs).
    *   **Network:** Ports 80, 443, 8006, 22 are open.
